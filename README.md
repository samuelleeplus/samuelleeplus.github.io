### Android App Development
---

Working with Professor [Altug Tanaltay](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/altug-tanaltay-590854a) to **develop native android mobile application.** This project was initially _inspired by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/),_ but **specifically focused on the region of East/SouthEast Asia,** matching users with restaurants according to their dietary preferences ( vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher ). 

Basic functionalities of the application includes:
- Login/Registration
- Search/List of Restaurants
- Restaurant Information (Payment, delivery, reviews, posts/comments etc...) 
- Menu selection/Order
- Reservation System


This was a **full-stack project**, developed using RESTful Web Services using **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.** For front-end development/GUI, Android Studio SDK & Emulator was used. 

**_Further details can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/androidApplication)._**
