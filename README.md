# Work Experience

### Algorithmics, TU Delft
***
During summer of 2020, I was a research intern in the [Algorithmics Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics) of TU Delft, Netherlands, under the supervision of Professor [Neil Yorke-Smith](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/0p6y8/).

We developed Apprenticeship Learning approach to Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with realistic constraints. Simulation was done with Google's open source [OR-Tool](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing) VRP library. Project details can be sent on request. 

### Undergraduate Researcher - Nanotech & Research Application
***
In 2019, I worked as a undergraduate researcher with a team under the supervision of [Stuart Lucas](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/slucas/) to develop computational strategies for assembly of heterozygous DNA sequence data, using HPC Cluster, SSH, SLURM commands, R & Python. Some of the work can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/researchApplication_PURE). 

### Intern, [Golflex](https://parkgolflex1.imweb.me/)
***
In summer of 2018, I worked as an intern to design E-Sports gaming environment and map using the company's game engine (**which is being used currently!**). I also was part of the graphic design team to create 2D objects using Adobe Photoshop, and render 3D objects using 3DS Max. 

# Software Projects

### Online Store 
***
As part of Software Engineering course, we developed a full-stack web application using .NET CORE framework, that presents limited products in different categories allowing for normal customers to purchase. A user management system was also implemented where product and sales manager may control/update inventory. Further details can be found in this [github repo.](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/onlineStore)

### Android App Development
---
Working with Professor [Altug Tanaltay](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/altug-tanaltay-590854a) to develop native android mobile application. The purpose of the application was inspired by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), but focused on the region of East/SouthEast Asia, matching users with restaurants according to their dietary preferensprince (vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher). This was a full-stack project, developed using RESTful Web Services using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework. For GUI, Android Studio SDK & Emulator was used.
