# Work Experience

---
### Research Intern - Algorithmics, TU Delft
---
During summer of 2020, I worked as a **research intern** in the [Algorithmics Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics) of TU Delft, Netherlands, under the supervision of [Professor Neil Yorke-Smith](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/0p6y8/).

We developed **Apprenticeship Learning approach to Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with realistic constraints.** Simulation was done with Google's open source [OR-Tool VRP library](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing). _Project details will be sent on request._

---
### Undergraduate Researcher - Nanotech & Research Application
---
In 2019, I worked as a **undergraduate researcher** with a team under the supervision of [Stuart James Lucas](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/slucas/) to develop **computational strategies for assembly of heterozygous DNA sequence data, using HPC Cluster, SSH, SLURM commands, R & Python.** Some of the work can be found in my _[github repo](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/researchApplication_PURE)._ 

---
### Intern, [Golflex](https://parkgolflex1.imweb.me/)
---
In summer of 2018, I worked as an **intern to design E-Sports gaming environment and map using the company's game engine (which is being used currently!**). I also was part of the graphic design team to **create 2D objects using Adobe Photoshop, and render 3D objects using 3DS Max.**

# Software Projects
---
### Online Store 
---
As part of Software Engineering course, we developed a **full-stack web application** using **.NET CORE** framework, that presents limited products in different categories allowing for normal customers to purchase.

Some implementations/functionalities of the project includes: 

- A user management system (Product Manager, Sales Manager, Admin) & Control/update of inventory
- Login/Registration
- Cart, Item Purchase
- Profile Page with account information (Address, Credit Card, Previous purchases etc...)
- PDF Invoice Email system (sent to user upon purchase)

Further details can be found in this **_[github repo.](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/onlineStore)_**

### Android App Development

---

Working with Professor [Altug Tanaltay](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/altug-tanaltay-590854a) to **develop native android mobile application.** This project was initially _inspired by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/),_ but **specifically focused on the region of East/SouthEast Asia,** matching users with restaurants according to their dietary preferences ( vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher ). 

Basic functionalities of the application includes:
- Login/Registration
- Search/List of Restaurants
- Restaurant Information (Payment, delivery, reviews, posts/comments etc...) 
- Menu selection/Order
- Reservation System


This was a **full-stack project**, developed using RESTful Web Services using **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.** For front-end development/GUI, Android Studio SDK & Emulator was used. 

**_Further details can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/androidApp)._**

### Cryptography - Ciphers & Blockchain
---
During fall of 2019, I took a course on Cryptography, familiarizing with concepts like:
- Shift Ciper, Affine Cipher, Vigenere Cipher 
- Modulos Congruences, LFSR
- AES, Rainbow Tables, Deterministic & Probabilistic RSA
- RSA-OAEP, El-Gamal, Kerberos, RSA signature, forward secrecy, DSA

Details for above can be found in **[this repo.](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/cryptography)**


I also developed software for **cryptocurrency using block chain, including digital signatures, blockchain transactions, proof of work & integration(Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).** Details can be found in **[this repo.](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/cryptography/tree/master/Implementing%20Cryptographic%20Primitive%20for%20BlockChain)**

---
### Bioinformatics 
---
Topics covered in this course includes :

- dynammic programming
- sequence alignment(local, global, pairwise, multiple, space efficient alignment algorithms, profile alignment)
- data analysis 
- Functional Interpretation of gene sets

**_Source code for above can be found in [this repo.](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/bioinformatics)_**

---
### Computational Biology 
---
I was part of a group that characterized **Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 4 Protein Family.** 

Some key contributions include: 
- TLR4 proteins were chosen from 15 different species 
- translated & aligned using both ClustalW & MUSCLE Multiple Sequence Alignment Algorithms (using MegaX Software)
- Phylogeny trees were made to determine its evolutionary tree.
- Python script to analyze & find conserved regions
- R-programming language script for visualization. 

**_Details for the following can be found in [this repo.](https://github.com/samuelleeplus/ens210-ComputationalBiology/tree/master/TLR4%20Protein%20Project)_**

---
### Ottoman Network Project
---
Under the supervision of [Yucel Saygin](http://sentilab.sabanciuniv.edu/people/), we developed an interactice web interface administration panel that performs basic CRUD operations, selections and search functionalities, **based on the Ottoman Social Network.**

We used **HTML & CSS for web user-interface, and PHP for backend database calls.**

**_Details for this project will be send upon request._**
